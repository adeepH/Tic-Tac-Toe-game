# Deep Tic Tac Toe
Here is the implementation of a classic example of a Markov Decision Process, a Tic Tac Toe game. Here we have employed two different approaches,namely:
- Deep Neural Network
- Deep Q-learning

# Game
`game.py` has the source code for the game of tic-tac-toe in python.

## Installation
   $ git clone https://github.com/adeepH/Tic-Tac-Toe-game
   $ cd Tic-Tac-Toe-game/
   $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

This project requires the following libraries to be installed.Please check these out if you don't have one of these (else follow the previous installation process):
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
-[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
-[Keras](https://keras.io/)
-[tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/)

# Abstract
`tictactoe.py` uses a Deep Neural Network in order to predict the best move possible.
